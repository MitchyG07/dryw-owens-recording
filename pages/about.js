                  Dryw <em>(prounced dru)</em> Owens is an Audio Engineer and
                  Music Producer based in Sacramento, California. From his early
                  days recording with his band, Consider the Thief, Dryw has
                  worked to tirelessly to perfect his craft since learning to
                  record, mix, and master in 2007. In 2009, Dryw decided it was
                  time to build his own studio, colloquially known as Little
                  Russia. Eventually, Little Russia moved away from its original
                  warehouse and Dryw Owens Recording was born; located
                  conveniently behind Dryw's home. Dryw has worked with many
                  notable artists including: Dance Gavin Dance, Sianvar, Hail
                  the Sun, Eidola, A Lot Like Birds, Mirours, Amber de La Rosa,
                  and Stablemate.
